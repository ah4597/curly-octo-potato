1. Pages:
    a. Homepage 
        i. List of all current available sets of terms/definitions.
        ii. An option to scrape/add to a set

        Clicking on a page gives us: 
        iii. Bar containing links to other pages 
            - Learn
            - Flashcards
            - Edit
        ii. All terms and definitions in a list
    
    b. Learn page
        i. Main focus?
        ii. Gives a term or definition, depending on a switch/mode randomly out of the ones that are not complete.
        iii. Another switch/mode for entering manually or for multiple choice
        iv. This will always be the opposite of what is given (i.e. if term is given, then we pick/enter definition)
        v. If what we entered matches exactly, then we give that term/definition a check.
        vi. A term/definition is marked complete when it has 2 checks.
        vii. When it doesn't match exactly, display the correct answer, and have an option for the the user to mark their answer as correct.
            - Do we want to store these additional correct answers?
        viii. An option somewhere to reset all to incomplete.
        
    c. Flashcards page
        i. Display either term/definition on front depending on a switch/mode
        ii. When clicked, it 'flips' (idk if i can do a flip lmao) over and displays the opposite.
        iii. Swipe, or click again to move onto next card.
        iv. A counter will be displayed (current card # / total cards)

    d. Edit page
        i. Can choose to edit/remove terms/definitions
